This space is aimed at helping people with getting familiarized with Polish, Turkish, Hungarian, Serbian (both Latin and Cyrillic based), Croatian and Bosniak spelling system. 
These languages use a modified Latin script with a lot of diacritic marks and digraphs, thus making them difficult for non-native speakers to pronounce or read the words 
properly. This space offers simplified spelling of words/sentence in the said languages.

For example, the Polish word Jaros≈Çaw, an English speaker who isn't familiar with Polish orthography will pronounce it as Jaroslav, while its actual Polish pronunciation 
is Yaroswav. Similary, the city of Przemy≈õl should be pronounced as Pzhemyshl, even though its not evident to an English speaker.

The approach for transliterating Polish language taken in this space is converting Polish character combinations to Cyrillic equivalents, which are single characters, thus 
simplifying our task greately.

Features added as of now:- 
-    Polish, Turkish, Hungarian, Serbo-Croatian-Bosniak language added.
-    Option for the user to choose any of the 3-4 examples available and pass it as input to the model.
-    Option for the user to generate a random but coherent sentence and pass it as input to the model. Acts as a nice playground for the user.
