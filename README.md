This space is aimed at helping people with getting familiarized with Polish orthography and pronunciation. Polish language uses a lot of character combinations which is unfamiliar to non-Poles, thus
making it harder to read, even though it employs a modified Latin script for writing. 

For example, the Polish word Jarosław, an English speaker who isn't familiar with Polish orthography will pronounce it as Jaroslav, while its actual Polish pronunciation 
is Yaroswav. Similary, the city of Przemyśl should be pronounced as Pzhemyshl, even though its not evident to an English speaker.

The approach for transliterating Polish language taken in this space is converting Polish character combinations to Cyrillic equivalents, which are single characters, thus 
simplifying our task greately.
